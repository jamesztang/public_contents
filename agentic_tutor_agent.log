>>>>Tool response: To solve the equation \( 2x + 3 = 7 \), follow these steps:

1. **Subtract 3 from both sides** to isolate the term with \( x \):
   \[
   2x + 3 - 3 = 7 - 3
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   2x = 4
   \]

2. **Divide both sides by 2** to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   \frac{2x}{2} = \frac{4}{2}
   \]
   This simplifies to:
   \[
   x = 2
   \]

Thus, the solution to the equation \( 2x + 3 = 7 \) is \( x = 2 \).

>>>>Tool response: To find out how many times greater the output of the modern turbine is compared to the early wind turbine, we need to divide the power output of the modern turbine by the power output of the early turbine.

1. Convert both outputs to the same unit. The early wind turbine produces 25 kW, and the modern turbine produces 3 MW. 

   We know that:
   \[
   1 \text{ MW} = 1000 \text{ kW}
   \]
   Therefore, 
   \[
   3 \text{ MW} = 3 \times 1000 \text{ kW} = 3000 \text{ kW}
   \]

2. Now we can calculate how many times greater the output of the modern turbine is:
   \[
   \text{Ratio} = \frac{\text{Output of modern turbine}}{\text{Output of early turbine}} = \frac{3000 \text{ kW}}{25 \text{ kW}}
   \]

3. Perform the division:
   \[
   \text{Ratio} = \frac{3000}{25} = 120
   \]

Thus, the output of the modern turbine is **120 times greater** than that of the early wind turbine.

6. **Control Systems**: Modern turbines are equipped with sophisticated control systems that monitor wind conditions and adjust operations accordingly. This includes yaw control to align the turbine with the wind direction, maximizing energy capture.

7. **Grid Integration**: Improved technology for integrating wind energy into the electrical grid allows for better management of variable energy sources, enhancing the overall efficiency and reliability of wind power generation.

These advancements collectively contribute to the significant increase in electricity generation capacity of modern wind turbines compared to their early counterparts.

The oil crises of the 1970s, which led to increased energy prices and concerns about energy security, spurred interest in alternative energy sources, including wind power.\n\nThe first modern wind farms were developed in California in the late 1970s, where a combination of state incentives and federal tax credits encouraged the installation of wind turbines. By the 1980s, these wind farms began to produce significant amounts of electricity, marking the transition from small, individual windmills to larger, utility-scale wind power installations.\n\nThe global wind power industry continued to grow throughout the 1990s and into the 21st century, with technological advancements leading to more efficient and larger turbines. By the early 2000s, wind power had established itself as a major player in the renewable energy sector, contributing to the diversification of energy sources and efforts to combat climate change. Today, wind power is one of the fastest-growing sources of electricity worldwide."

>>>>Tutor response: Large-scale wind power first became significant in energy history in the late 20th century, particularly during the 1970s and 1980s. The oil crises of the 1970s spurred interest in alternative energy sources, leading to the development of the first modern wind farms in California in the late 1970s. By the 1980s, wind farms began producing significant electricity, marking the shift to utility-scale wind power. The industry grew through the 1990s and 21st century, with technological advancements making wind power a major renewable energy source today.

Regarding the output comparison: 
- An early wind turbine produced 25 kW.
- A modern turbine produces 3 MW, which is 3000 kW.
- The modern turbine's output is 3000 kW / 25 kW = 120 times greater than the early turbine.

The scientific principles and technological advancements that allow modern turbines to generate so much more electricity include:
1. Advanced aerodynamic blade design for efficient wind capture.
2. Larger rotor sizes that sweep a greater area, capturing more wind energy.
3. Use of lightweight, strong materials enabling longer blades.
4. Variable pitch control to optimize blade angle for different wind speeds.
5. Improved gearbox and generator technology for better energy conversion.
6. Sophisticated control systems for aligning turbines with wind direction and optimizing performance.
7. Enhanced grid integration technology for managing variable energy sources efficiently.

These factors together enable modern wind turbines to produce vastly more electricity than early models.
